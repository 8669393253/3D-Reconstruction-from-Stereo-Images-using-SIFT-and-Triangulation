# 3D-Reconstruction-from-Stereo-Images-using-SIFT-and-Triangulation
This project demonstrates how to perform 3D reconstruction from two images taken from different viewpoints using feature detection and matching. The core algorithms used are SIFT for feature detection and FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours) for feature matching. The reconstructed 3D points are then visualized using matplotlib.
